# From2To
From Speech Recognition results to subtitles and Karaoke-style presentation
The result of Automatic Speech Recognition is in mmost cases a list of recognised words with their start time and end time and/or duration in a specific time format. Skipping all the time info results in plain text which may be usefull. However, more is possible if you include the time information in the "presentation" of the ASR results.
From2To converts the output of different ASR-engines into SRT-files, VTT-files and/or Karaoke-style html-files.
The program is written in good old Delphi for both Windows (32-bit and 64-bit) and MacOS (64-bit).
